---------- lib:
The library can be used even if the service is not running nor installed.
The deps are minimal

---------- service:
- activity encryption
For the encryption to work, FUSE needs to be propertly set up and encfs installed.
If the locations of fusermount and encfs are not standard (/bin/fusermount and /usr/bin/encfs)
you can set the custom ones via:
    cmake -DFUSERMOUNT_PATH="/path/to/fusermount" -DENCFS_PATH="/path/to/encfs" ....
